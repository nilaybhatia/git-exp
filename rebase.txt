Writing this from dev

[Writing from dev]
Created a new file with the line "Writing this from master"
Now checked out a new branch and edited the word master to dev
in the above line and adding these explanatory line. Now will commit
these changes. What happens when I checkout master and run git rebase dev?

[Writing from master]
Same as that with merge, changes of master are overwritten by changes from dev.
What about making conflicting changes (w.r.t dev) in master, checking out dev and running git rebase master?
What about making changes in master and checking out dev and running git rebase master?

[Writing from dev]
There weren't merge conflicts so just the lines got added.
Now I'll commit this, switch back to master and ...
make a conflicting change, and run git rebase master after switching back to dev
Ok, same as merge, got a merge conflict, aborted.

Kept both changes.
