[Typing from original local repo on laptop]
Will attempt to do the following:

There are already the following repos:
origin  https://github.com/nilaybhatia/git-exp.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/nilaybhatia/git-exp.git (push)
The current local repo on laptop.

Will try to create 
i. another repo on laptop which will have current repo as remote (i.e local remote)
ii. a new repo in phone which will have the current repo in laptop as remote (i.e on the network)

I am committing this sentence from original local repo. When I create the new local repo (i) on laptop and then
pull, this statement and its associated commit should automatically appear.

[Typing from the newly-created local repo on laptop]
Init-ed a new git repo named git-exp-remote-prac and set the original local repo as the local-origin:
git remote add local-origin /home/nilay/git-exp
Then did `git pull local-origin remote-prac`. This pulled the branch from original local repo into new local repo.
This local remote-prac has the commit ("Committing from original local repo on laptop") from the original as expected.
Will commit this text on the remote-prac branch and then will do `git push local-origin remote-prac`. This para
should then appear in the original local repo (git-exp).
