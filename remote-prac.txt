[Typing from original local repo on laptop]
Will attempt to do the following:

There are already the following repos:
origin  https://github.com/nilaybhatia/git-exp.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/nilaybhatia/git-exp.git (push)
The current local repo on laptop.

Will try to create
i. another repo on laptop which will have current repo as remote (i.e local remote)
ii. a new repo in phone which will have the current repo in laptop as remote (i.e on the network)

I am committing this sentence from original local repo. When I create the new local repo (i) on laptop and then
pull, this statement and its associated commit should automatically appear.

[Typing from the newly-created local repo on laptop]
Init-ed a new git repo named git-exp-remote-prac and set the original local repo as the local-origin:
git remote add local-origin /home/nilay/git-exp
Then did `git pull local-origin remote-prac`. This pulled the branch from original local repo into new local repo.
This local remote-prac has the commit ("Committing from original local repo on laptop") from the original as expected.
Will commit this text on the remote-prac branch and then will do `git push local-origin remote-prac`. This para
should then appear in the original local repo (git-exp).

[Typing from original local repo on laptop]
I initially push from that new repo as written above but got the message:
remote: error: refusing to update checked out branch: refs/heads/remote-prac
remote: error: By default, updating the current branch in a non-bare repository
remote: is denied, because it will make the index and work tree inconsistent
remote: with what you pushed, and will require 'git reset --hard' to match
remote: the work tree to HEAD.
remote:
remote: You can set the 'receive.denyCurrentBranch' configuration variable
remote: to 'ignore' or 'warn' in the remote repository to allow pushing into
remote: its current branch; however, this is not recommended unless you
remote: arranged to update its work tree to match what you pushed in some
remote: other way.
remote:
remote: To squelch this message and still keep the default behaviour, set
remote: 'receive.denyCurrentBranch' configuration variable to 'refuse'.
To /home/nilay/git-exp
 ! [remote rejected] remote-prac -> remote-prac (branch is currently checked out)

So we can't push to a branch in remote which is currenly checked out in remote. So I temporarily switched to master on original,
pushed successfully from new and switched to remote-prac on orignal and as expected the para from the new repo is there.
Now will push current branch to current branch's origin (github repo).

Good read: http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-The-Protocols

[Typing from cloned repo in mobile]
The original repo was cloned using ssh like this:
git clone ssh://nilay@192.168.71.3:/home/nilay/git-exp
After turning off mobile data, made a commit on original, then did 
git pull origin remote-prac and got the change here as well.

[Typing from original local repo on laptop]
Worked as expected. Mobile data was still turned off, got commit from the mobile repo here.
BTW on running `git remote -v` on mobile, got the output:
origin ssh://nilay@192.168.71.3:/home/nilay/git-exp (fetch)
"           "           "           "           "   (pull)
(Cloning sets the remote automatically)

Will push all of this to github remote. Exp concludes for now.
