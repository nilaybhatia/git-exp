[Typing from original local repo on laptop]
Will attempt to do the following:

There are already the following repos:
origin  https://github.com/nilaybhatia/git-exp.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/nilaybhatia/git-exp.git (push)
The current local repo on laptop.

Will try to create 
i. another repo on laptop which will have current repo as remote (i.e local remote)
ii. a new repo in phone which will have the current repo in laptop as remote (i.e on the network)

I am committing this sentence from original local repo. When I create the new local repo (i) on laptop and then
pull, this statement and its associated commit should automatically appear.
