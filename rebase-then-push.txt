Situation:

Branch was checked out from a commit on local master. Then there were some commits on origin/master. Current branch
needed those commits from origin/master, but forgot and instead pushed feature to remote. (Doing it now...)

Okay, pushed to origin but now realized, need that file from origin master coz check failed.
What I did: Checkout local master, pull origin/master. Then checkout feature, git rebase master, git push feature.
Will commit and do all this now.

While pushing feature to remote, got the message:
To github-nilay:nilaybhatia/git-exp.git
 ! [rejected]        rebase-then-push -> rebase-then-push (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'github-nilay:nilaybhatia/git-exp.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

Then blindly did git pull origin rebase-then-push without understanding anything :((( Then pushed again.
Now origin/rebase-then-push has 2 duplicate commits (the very 1st commit on this feature branch -- "Add initail situation
to file") with the same text but different commit hashes. Also, the commit "Create changes_for_rebase-then-push.txt" from master
has been duplicated on this branch too.

What happened: SO link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9264314/git-commits-are-duplicated-in-the-same-branch-after-doing-a-rebase

Rebase wan't required, just use merge.
