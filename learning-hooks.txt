Hooks are local to any given Git repository, and they are not copied over to the new repository
when you run git clone.
...remember that each developer can alter their own local hooks, so you can’t use them as a way to enforce a commit policy.
They can, however, make it much easier for developers to adhere to certain guidelines.
All of the pre- hooks let you alter the action that’s about to take place,
while the post- hooks are used only for notifications.

Server side hooks reside in the remote .git/hooks repo. Remote repo is not necessarily on GitHub,
can be set up on a local server as well: https://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/git/setting-up-your-remote-repository-with-git/
