This is on master
Added this line from master

[Adding this from dev branch]
1st I created a file on master with the 1st line
*
Then branched out to the branch dev
   dev   *
        /
master *
Modified the 1st line as "This is on dev"
   dev   * - *
        /
master *
Switched back to master, added the 2nd line
   dev   * - *
        /
master * - *
Switched back to dev, tried running git merge master, conflicts, aborted
Modified the 1st line of file on dev manually to match master
   dev   * - * - *
        /
master * - *
Then ran git merge master on dev, no conflicts
   dev   * - * - * - *
        /   ________/
master * - *
Note that the merge operation itself creates a new commit.
If you run git log on dev you'll see 5 commits -- 1 common commit after which dev branched off,
then 1st commit of dev, then 2nd commit of master, then edit commit of dev, then the merge commit
Finally, I am going to commit this explanation too.

[Adding this from master]
Switched to master and ran git merge dev. Ofc no conflicts. It says "Fast forward", which
makes sense because master was behind and dev had a few commits so now master has
all commits of dev and has caught up.
                         |> the commit explaining merge
   dev   * - [* - * - * - *]
        /      \   \   \   \
master * - * - [*   *   *   *]
No new commit is created.
Now commiting this explanation from master. Would look like this
   dev   * - * - * - * - *
        /              
master * - * - [*   *   *   *] - *
